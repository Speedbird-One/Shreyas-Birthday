            officially an "adult". He has now matured and has all sorts of
            responsibilities. He now has the Right to Vote, and most importantly
            the ability to legally consume alcohol.

            friends. (I gues he can ride bike also, but it is very unlikely. He
            will give up before he learns to use the clutch. So most probably he
            will ride scooter only.)

            unweighted CGPA. He will hence proceed to be the top student of his
